    """Return the current ReusableExectutor instance.

    Start a new instance if it has not been started already or if the previous
    instance was left in a broken state.

    If the previous instance does not have the requested number of workers, the
    executor is dynamically resized to adjust the number of workers prior to
    returning.

    Reusing a singleton instance spares the overhead of starting new worker
    processes and importing common python packages each time.

    ``max_workers`` controls the maximum number of tasks that can be running in
    parallel in worker processes. By default this is set to the number of
    CPUs on the host.

    Setting ``timeout`` (in seconds) makes idle workers automatically shutdown
    so as to release system resources. New workers are respawn upon submission
    of new tasks so that ``max_workers`` are available to accept the newly
    submitted tasks. Setting ``timeout`` to around 100 times the time required
    to spawn new processes and import packages in them (on the order of 100ms)
    ensures that the overhead of spawning workers is negligible.

    Setting ``kill_workers=True`` makes it possible to forcibly interrupt
    previously spawned jobs to get a new instance of the reusable executor
    with new constructor argument values.

    The ``job_reducers`` and ``result_reducers`` are used to customize the
    pickling of tasks and results send to the executor.

    When provided, the ``initializer`` is run first in newly spawned
    processes with argument ``initargs``.

    The environment variable in the child process are a copy of the values in
    the main process. One can provide a dict ``{ENV: VAL}`` where ``ENV`` and
    ``VAL`` are string literals to overwrite the environment variable ``ENV``
    in the child processes to value ``VAL``. The environment variables are set
    in the children before any module is loaded. This only works with the
    ``loky`` context.
